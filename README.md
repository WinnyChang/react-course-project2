# Course Final Project

This project is part of the "Developing Front-End Apps with React" course, an online non-credit program authorized by IBM and offered through Coursera.

Through this project, I have reinforced my ability to:

- **Create React components:** Build functional React components using component composition and nesting.
- **Manage state with hooks:** Implement React Hooks, specifically `useState` and `useEffect`, to manage component-level state and control element visibility.
- **Integrate Redux:** Use Redux within an application, applying key concepts such as actions, reducers, and the store.
- **Render dynamic data:** Dynamically display data from an array of objects in the UI by mapping over arrays to generate lists of components.
- **Handle events with conditional rendering:** Manage user interactions, such as button selections, and trigger corresponding actions through conditional rendering.
